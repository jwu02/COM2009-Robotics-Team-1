Task 5 algorithm draft

Move foward if possible
    if path to left
        turn left
    else
        moveforward until obstacle ahead
        if path left turn left else turn right
    
    if turn left no path to left
        follow wall left
    else
        follow wall right

    store position and orientation and turn command in array topological_map?

=============== current problems
- detecting colours lot harder in real world than simulation, lots of testing needed
- turtlebot3_slam package doesn't exist on local env
- robot just spins around in some cases (tune self.lim_ang_vel?)

=============== guarantee some marks
- store picture of any beacon unless picture of target beacon already taken
