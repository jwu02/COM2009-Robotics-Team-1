Task 5 algorithm draft

Move foward if possible
    if path to left
        turn left
    else
        moveforward until obstacle ahead
        if path left turn left else turn right
    
    if turn left no path to left
        follow wall left
    else
        follow wall right

    store position and orientation and turn command in array topological_map?

=============== current problems
- map only saved at start
- detecting colours lot harder in real world than simulation, lots of testing needed
- things to tune
    - robot just spins around in some cases (tune self.lim_ang_vel so robot can about to collide into wall?)
    - distance to follow from wall
    - distance to stop in front of wall
- alternative exploration strategy?

=============== guarantee some marks
- store picture of any beacon unless picture of target beacon already taken

=============== THINGS TO CHANGE FOR TASK5 SUBMISSION
